    <h1>
        Understanding PoSV
    </h1>

    <p>
        In its most basic form, we can think of PoSV simply as compounding interest. It was designed to offer 5-6%
        interest, compounding every time you stake (produce new coins). For a rough approximation of returns under near
        optimal conditions, we will calculate the returns for 5% interest compounded daily.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>
        Isn't it a bit more complicated than that?
    </h2>

    <p>
        It is of course. Under PoSV, your returns are greatly influenced by how often you successfully stake. This is
        due to the mathematical formula of PoSV, and not a product of how often your interest is compounded.
    </p>

    <div class="info" title="More Info: How Important is Compounding">
        <p>
            Not very important. While compounding your interest more times does result in more coins, this is not
            a relevant incentive of PoSV.
        </p>
        <p>
            To demonstrate, we can use the calculator above to calculate interest on 1 million coins compounded one time
            versus 365 times. The difference is about 1,267 coins, or 0.13%. This example uses two very extreme cases
            and the difference is still relatively insignificant. In practice, the difference will be even less.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        To begin understanding PoSV, we need to first understand when, or how often, you stake.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's easiest to think about this in terms of a lottery. Everyone with reddcoins has many "lottery tickets."
        Approximately every minute, one lottery ticket is chosen, and whoever wins gets awarded newly created coins.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have reddcoins in your wallet, you have some lottery tickets. Whoever has the most lottery tickets has
        the best chance of winning. To enter the lottery just make sure your wallet is <i>staking</i>, and it will enter
        the drawing for you every minute.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before we can understand how many tickets each person gets, we'll need to review
        a few important concepts.
    </p>

    <hr>

	<h3>
		What is <i>staking</i> ?
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		Staking is the process your wallet uses to validate transactions and award you with coins. When your wallet is
        staking, it is checking transactions to make sure everyone who sends coins actually owned those coins and had the
        right to transfer them. If most of the wallets online agree that a transaction is valid, then it gets accepted
        by the network. This concept of consensus is essential to all digital currencies, and is what keeps Reddcoin secure.
	</p>


    <div class="tip" title="Tip: How to Stake">
        <p>
            In order to stake, ensure that your wallet is encrypted and unlocked. By keeping your wallet open, it will
            stake automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you encrypt your wallet, make sure to use a strong password that you will never
            forget. You cannot recover your password or coins if you forget your password.
        </p>
    </div>

	<p>
        As a reward for keeping the network secure, every minute one person is chosen to receive some interest on the
        coins they own. Whoever has the most "lottery tickets" has the best chance of winning the award.
	</p>
    <p>
        In Reddcoin terms, your lottery tickets are referred to as your "Weighted Coin Age" or simply <i>weight</i>, and
        your weight is a non-linear product of <i>coin age</i>.
    </p>

	
	<h3>
		What is <i>coin age</i> ?
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		Quite simply, <i>coin age</i> is the age of your coins. Imagine you get a new wallet and start out with zero coins.
        On Monday, your friend sends you 5,000 coins. On Wednesday, you decide to buy 10,000 more coins and withdraw them
        to your wallet.
	</p>

	<p>
        Assuming it's Thursday, you'll have two groups of coins. The first group of 5,000 has 3 days of coin age,
        and the second group of 10,000 coins has 1 day of coin age.
	</p>

	<p>
        When coins are sent to another address or successfully stake (generate interest), their coin age is reset.
	</p>

    <div class="info" title="More Info: Staking by Group">
        <p>
            It's important to recognize that staking happens in groups. So, following our example above, if your first
            group of 5,000 coins stakes, you'll get an interest payed on those 5,000 coins, not your entire balance of
            15,000 coins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, coin age will be reset on your group of 5,000, but coinage on your second group of 10,000 will
            continue to grow until they stake or are used in a transaction.
        </p>
    </div>

	<h2>
		What is the <i>network weight</i>, <i>total weight</i>, and <i>expected time</i> until next reward ?
	</h2>

    <div class="tip" title="Tip: View Weight Information">
        <p>
            In your reddcoin wallet, you can view weight information at the bottom right of your wallet if you let your
            mouse hover over the green arrow which indicates that your wallet is currently staking.
        </p>
    </div>
	
	<p id="whatsablock">
		According to the reddcoin protocol, every minute there's a lottery going on, 
		which will result in a single block being discovered.
	</p>

    <div class="info" title="More Info: What's a Block?">
        <p>
            A block is essentially a group of Reddcoin transactions. When you stake, your wallet attempts to "Solve"
            the current block by making a guess about an unknown password which unlocks the block. It takes a lot of guesses
            to find the password, but once you find it, you inform all the other wallets that you found the block and tell
            them the password you discovered.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other wallets will check that password to make sure it actually unlocks the block. When enough of them
            report back that your password was correct, you have solved the block and as a reward you get paid interest.
        </p>

        <p>
            In PoSV, the more coin weight you have, the easier it is for you to guess the password. Each block has many
            "passwords" and it's possible that two people solve the same block. When this happens, Reddcoin will give the
            award to the person who has the most coin weight.
        </p>
    </div>

    -->

	<p>
		The <i>network weight</i> can be understood as the number of tickets available for this lottery. 
		In practice the network weight is the sum of "weighted coin age" of all the coins which are staking at this
        moment accross the entire network. Let's call this number NW (for "network weight").
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now your <i>total weight</i> is the number of tickets <i>you</i> own which allow you to participate in this lottery. 
		It is calculated by summing up all the coinage of the coins which are staking in your wallet. 
		Let's call this number TW (for "total weight").
	</p>

    <div class="imageContainer">

        <img src="img/tickets.png" alt="A representation of tickets owned.">

        <p class="small">
            A visual representation of your "Tickets" compared to total tickets.
        </p>
    </div>

	<p>	
		Now you need to know that this lottery is <i>fair</i> in the sense that each "ticket" is equally likely to win 
		on the next round. The details by which the winner is found is internal to the protocol implementation, but a
        simplified explanation can be found in the
        <a href="#whatsablock">"What's a Block?" info section.</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		That being said, since different participants own different number of 
		those tickets, the more of them you own, the quicker you can expect to be a winner, this is the <i>expected time</i> 
		until your next reward. Of course the lottery is random so nothing is 100% certain. It could effectively take less time 
		(if you're lucky) or more time (if you're less lucky :P) than the expected time for you to actually win. But in the long
		run, those differences average out and you would see that the expected time is pretty accurate (as long as you keep your
		wallet online 24/7).
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		To be more mathematically specific, on each minute round you have a chance NW/TW to be the lucky winner. It is
		a simple result that as a consequence the expected time to be a winner is NW/TW minutes.

		Let's now see how these things work in practice. Let's assume that right now the network weight is about 13B (13,000,000,000)

	<p>
		13B/100m = 130minutes
	</p>
	
	<p>
		so in expectation to get a reward, it would take you about 2hrs in that case. Check it with your wallet and see
		if the formula works!

        Just to put things back in the context of posv, winning here means discovering a block which will not only award you

	<h2>
		What is the <i>average weight</i> ?
	</h2>

	<p>
		We mentionned before that in the wallet, coins stake in <i>groups</i> of coins which arrived in your wallet during a single transaction.
	</p>

    <div class="tip" title="Hidden feature: the Coin Control menu">
        <p>
            In your reddcoin wallet, you can have access to a very detailed description of the content of your wallet. In order to unlock it you need to go to
            Preferences->Display and check <i>"Display coin control features (experts only!)"</i>. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Although we are not experts yet we can have a look. Now let's go to the <i>"Send"</i> tab. A new zone apppears on top of the regular gui used to send reddcoins. 
        	It is called <i>"Coin Control Features"</i>. If you now click on <i>"Inputs"</i> you will raise a new window which will display <i>all</i> the groups of coins 
        	which your wallet is made of.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Click on <i>"List mode"</i>. You will see a series of lines. Each line corresponds to a group of coins sharing the same coinage since they arrived in your wallet
        	during the same transaction. The "Date" column indicates the time this group of coins landed in your wallet and "Address" is the actual address where those coins
        	were received (we remind you that your wallet can contain multiple receiving addresses!).
        </p>
    </div>

	<p>
		If you take a look at the <i>Coin Control</i> menu you will discover how many groups your wallet is made of. Now each such group has a corresponding coin weight. 
		As we said in the previous section the total weight is the sum of all those group's coin weights. Now the <i>average weight</i> is simply the average of the coin weights 
		of each group!
	</p>

    <h2>
        So how is weight calculated?
    </h2>

    <p>
        The calculation of coin weight is the core of PoSV. Like traditional PoS, the weight is a product of total coins
        (stake) and the average age of those coins. In contrast to traditional PoS, which calculates weight as a linear
        product of age, PoSV uses an algorithm where new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly
        slowly. This is how PoSV offers a big incentive to be active.
    </p>

    <p>
        To see the PoSV algorithm in action, we can look at a graph of coin weight over age.
    </p>

    <select id="weightGraphAge">
        <option value="3">3 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="7">7 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="10">10 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="31">30 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="90">90 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="120">120 Day Coin Age</option>
        <option value="360">365 Day Coin Age</option>
    </select>

    <canvas id="weightChart" width="650" height="400"></canvas>

    <p>
        For the first week, you can see that coin weight is a linear function of coin age that grows faster than POS. 
        On the other hand even though coins continue to accrue weight with time, they do a slower and slower pace
        compared to POS.
    </p>
    
	<p>
		In order to better visualise the relative speed at which POSV and POS accrue weight for their coin,
		the next graph shows the <i>ratio</i> of POSV to POS weights. The peak of 1.2 means that at
		1 week, the coins which stake in the POSV wallet accrue weight 20% <i>faster</i> than their POS counterpart.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		On the other hand after 2 weeks the POSV coins start to accrue weight <i>slower</i> than POS. This is why it is
		said that POSV encourages staking over a relatively short period of time compared to POS.

    <h2>
        How much do I earn when I mint?
    </h2>


    <p>
        Every time you successfully stake coins, you get paid interest on the weighted age of those coins. To make this
        more clear, we'll use some examples and compare weighted age (PoSV) to calendar age (Traditional PoS).
    </p>

    <p>
        With traditional PoS, coins are not age-weighted. One calendar day corresponds to one coin age day. What this
        means is that you could gather 10,000 coins and close your wallet for a year. When you open it back up, your
        coins would have gained a year's worth of age. Since they're so old, they'll have a high probability of staking
        immediately. When they do stake, they'll pay the entire year's worth of interest. So those 10,000 coins will pay
        5% interest (500 coins) on 365 days worth of age. Similarly, if they were to stake with an age of one month,
        they would earn one month worth of interest at 5% (~42 coins)
    </p>

    <p>
        With PoSV, interest is paid on the weighted age instead of the actual age. So if you have 10,000 Reddcoins which
        stake with a calendar age of one year (365 days) you'll only get paid interest on 41 days. This means you would
        only get a return of 57 coins, instead of the 500 they would have got in traditional PoS. This is a great
        incentive to keep your wallet open and secure the network.
    </p>

    <div class="info" title="More Info: Shuffling Coins for Optimal Age">
        <p>
            TODO: Figure out how this actually works. This stuff could very well be made up, I don't remember where I
            heard it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to ensure you're getting the best returns possible, Reddcoin will move your coins around to reset
            their age after they get to a point where the return is not high. Additionally, when you spend coins, Reddcoin
            will spend your oldest coins first, since they will yield the worst interest rate if they were to stake
            instead of being spent.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In contrast to the example of staking with old coins, Reddcoin offers an extra reward for coins that stake with
        a low age. According to the PoSV algorithm, a coin which stakes with a calendar age of 7 days will receive 5%
        interest on 8 days. This means that under optimal conditions, you can receive more than 5% interest.
    </p>

    <p>
        To understand a bit better, let's look at a graph of annual interest depending on the average coin age when
        staking occurs.

        To see how all of this fits together we've created a staking simulator. What we'll do here is define the total
        network weight and assume it remains constant for the entire simulated year. For simplicity, we'll also assume
        that all of your coins are in one group and that they will stay in that group the entire year. Your coins will
        start with a coinage of zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will simulate every minute of the year by calculating your current weighted age and generating a random
        number to determine if you successfully stake that minute. If you do, you'll receive interest and your coinage
        will be reset. If you don't, we'll increase your coinage by one minute and then try to stake again.
